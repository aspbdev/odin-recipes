    <h2 class="recipe-subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="recipe-ingredients">
        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons peanut oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups diced onion </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="recipe-subtitle">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="recipe-steps">
        <li>Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and the black pepper. 
            Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. 
            Add half the chicken; cook until no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a plate. 
            Repeat with 1 tablespoon oil and remaining chicken.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pot and reduce heat to medium. 
            Add onion; cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, 
            coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt;
             cook, stirring, 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Stir in broth, tomatoes, sweet potato, collard greens, and red bell 
            peppers; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, partially 
            covered, until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return chicken and accumulated juices to the pot. 
            Return to a boil, then stir in peanut butter; simmer until 
            incorporated and chicken is cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. 
            Garnish with chopped peanuts.</li>
